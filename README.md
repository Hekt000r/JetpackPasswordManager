# Jetpack Password storer

This is a very basic password storer created with React, Express and MySQL

Dependencies : CORS, Axios, React (Create React App), Express, Node, MySQL.

Get started by cloning running `` npm install `` in both server and client

Notice: This was one of my first projects, as result its very MID. It was mainly to learn things like CORS axios and MySQL. Check out my other projects
And its not very secure. It encrypts with AES-256 although is very easy to decrypt the passwords.
